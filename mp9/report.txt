1. edit app.py:
    use re to compile the input string into a regular expression, and then use findall to get a list of matches, 
    result += length of the list in each iteration 
    Add cache:
        define a global dictionary called cache, save the search result in the dict every time after search. If the search word is all already
        in the cache, directly result the value.
2.just build the docker following the two commands
3. first,  start a project on GCP console, then do the commands in the terminal stated in the 
    in the mp document. 
    
    Something else to do:  Put docker into sudo group and then log out and log in again, 
    or cannot execute "gcloud docker push" 
    
    change deploy.yaml:   changed the image to gcr.io/cs398-mp9
    also, change the API version in first line to be v1beta1

    the output looks like:
    NAME                                READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx-deployment-55f76dbcb8-9p7k6   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          10s
    nginx-deployment-55f76dbcb8-d4fkn   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          10s
    nginx-deployment-55f76dbcb8-wtkz8   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          10s

4. copy the code in the docker example, and then change the ip address, expose the external ip to
local host 8080, and then I can access the web
